            <h2>The Movie</h2>

            <p>Since the chitauri attack on New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has been having trouble sleeping, and when he does, he has terrible nightmares. He fears he will not be able to protect his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) from
                the many enemies he has since wearing the Iron Man armor. One of them, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), decides to attack him with full force, destroying his mansion and putting Pepper's life at risk. To face it, Stark will need to rise from
                the bottom of the sea, where he was taken along with the wreckage of the mansion, and overcome his greatest fear: that of failing.</p>
